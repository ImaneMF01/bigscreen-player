<p begin="00:00:36.12" id="p1" end="00:00:40.72">
Home to more than
<br/>
700 million people.
</p>
<p begin="00:00:45.60" id="p2" end="00:00:50.84">
This is a continent that has been
<br/>
transformed by humanity.
</p>
<p begin="00:00:55.36" id="p3" end="00:00:57.40">It is a crowded world.</p>
<p begin="00:01:04.28" id="p4" end="00:01:06.68">But not all of it.</p>
<p begin="00:01:08.52" id="p5" end="00:01:13.56">
There are still precious areas
<br/>
of wilderness
</p>
<p begin="00:01:13.56" id="p6" end="00:01:18.12">
and, living within them,
<br/>
some very surprising animals.
</p>
<p begin="00:01:34.68" id="p7" end="00:01:37.48">SQUAWKING</p>
<p begin="00:01:37.48" id="p8" end="00:01:40.96">Forest once covered 80% of Europe.</p>
<p begin="00:01:42.92" id="p9" end="00:01:45.00">CHIRPING</p>
<p begin="00:01:45.00" id="p10" end="00:01:48.12">Now only half of it remains.</p>

<p begin="00:02:09.64" id="p12" end="00:02:11.16">A brown bear.</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.44" id="p13" end="00:02:21.76">
One of only 1,500 that are left
<br/>
in Finland's forests.
</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.68" id="p14" end="00:02:25.04">CUBS SQUEAK</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.44" id="p15" end="00:02:35.04">
Her cubs have recently emerged
<br/>
from their nursery den.
</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.28" id="p16" end="00:02:45.52">
The long summer days means there's
<br/>
plenty of time for play.
</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.48" id="p17" end="00:03:08.96">With two boisterous cubs...</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.64" id="p18" end="00:03:16.24">..it pays to rest, whenever you can.</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.56" id="p19" end="00:03:23.16">
But their mother must be on her
<br/>
guard.
</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.00" id="p20" end="00:03:31.56">The cubs have spotted something.</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.92" id="p21" end="00:03:39.36">A large male, looking for a mate.</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.80" id="p22" end="00:03:48.92">The cubs aren't his.</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.16" id="p23" end="00:03:53.56">So he might try to kill them.</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.52" id="p24" end="00:03:58.52">Bear cubs are excellent climbers.</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.72" id="p25" end="00:04:04.56">
And now they're beyond his reach,
<br/>
15 metres up.
</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.64" id="p26" end="00:04:08.00">MAKES GUTTURAL, PULSING SOUND</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.00" id="p27" end="00:04:11.96">
Their mother warns him
<br/>
to keep his distance.
</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.52" id="p28" end="00:04:19.60">
But the cubs are coming down too
<br/>
soon.
</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.92" id="p29" end="00:04:29.20">MAKES GUTTURAL, PULSING SOUND</p>

<p begin="00:04:47.96" id="p32" end="00:04:50.60">That was a close call.</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.08" id="p33" end="00:05:12.00">
Finland's forests give us a glimpse
<br/>
of what Europe was once like.
</p>
<p begin="00:05:14.12" id="p34" end="00:05:20.12">
A land of endless wilderness,
<br/>
where large animals roamed far and
<br/>
wide.
</p>
<p begin="00:05:27.96" id="p35" end="00:05:32.32">
In the north, the continent extends
<br/>
beyond the Arctic Circle.
</p>
<p begin="00:05:47.08" id="p36" end="00:05:51.60">
Here, the skies are illuminated
<br/>
by the aurora borealis,
</p>
<p begin="00:05:51.60" id="p37" end="00:05:53.88">the northern lights.</p>
<p begin="00:05:58.72" id="p38" end="00:06:00.64">Trillions of charged particles,</p>
<p begin="00:06:00.64" id="p39" end="00:06:03.64">
ejected by electric storms on the
<br/>
sun,

<p begin="00:06:05.68" id="p41" end="00:06:08.92">
to create
<br/>
this surreal nocturnal spectacle.
</p>
<p begin="00:06:13.52" id="p42" end="00:06:18.12">But by day, this is a barren land.</p>
<p begin="00:06:28.16" id="p43" end="00:06:31.52">The Dovrefjell mountains of Norway.</p>
<p begin="00:06:36.08" id="p44" end="00:06:39.52">
One of the last refuges
<br/>
for an animal that once lived
</p>
<p begin="00:06:39.52" id="p45" end="00:06:41.32">all across northern Europe.</p>
<p begin="00:06:42.52" id="p46" end="00:06:44.64">GRUNTS</p>
<p begin="00:06:50.88" id="p47" end="00:06:52.28">The musk ox.</p>
<p begin="00:07:12.40" id="p48" end="00:07:14.72">This bull is in his prime.</p>
<p begin="00:07:16.44" id="p49" end="00:07:21.60">
He protects the herd
<br/>
and fathers all the calves.
</p>
<p begin="00:07:21.60" id="p50" end="00:07:22.64">BELLOWS</p>
<p begin="00:07:25.04" id="p51" end="00:07:27.88">
His is a greatly sought-after
<br/>
rank...
</p>
<p begin="00:07:31.40" id="p52" end="00:07:32.44">BLEATS</p>
<p begin="00:07:32.44" id="p53" end="00:07:35.28">
..and that means that,
<br/>
in the mating season,
</p>
<p begin="00:07:35.28" id="p54" end="00:07:38.12">he has to deal with rivals.</p>
<p begin="00:07:47.28" id="p55" end="00:07:48.92">And here is one.</p>
<p begin="00:08:06.72" id="p56" end="00:08:12.08">
Raking the ground is a warning
<br/>
to other males to keep away.
</p>
<p begin="00:08:13.96" id="p57" end="00:08:15.84">But some ignore it.</p>
<p begin="00:08:22.16" id="p58" end="00:08:27.04">
He now has no choice
<br/>
but to defend his crown.
</p>
<p begin="00:08:32.64" id="p59" end="00:08:34.56">GRUNTS</p>
<p begin="00:08:39.48" id="p60" end="00:08:41.20">The challenger attacks.</p>
<p begin="00:09:00.28" id="p61" end="00:09:03.12">
Each male weighs nearly half a
<br/>
tonne.
</p>
<p begin="00:09:17.68" id="p62" end="00:09:21.64">
These clashes are usually short
<br/>
and intense,
</p>
<p begin="00:09:21.64" id="p63" end="00:09:24.44">but not this time.</p>
<p begin="00:09:30.00" id="p64" end="00:09:34.40">
As his family looks on,
<br/>
neither gives in.
</p>
<p begin="00:09:36.36" id="p65" end="00:09:40.16">
The bull will need to draw
<br/>
on all his experience.
</p>
<p begin="00:09:54.00" id="p66" end="00:09:56.44">But he's beginning to lose ground.</p>
<p begin="00:10:11.60" id="p67" end="00:10:13.48">Now he's broadsided.</p>
<p begin="00:10:14.72" id="p68" end="00:10:18.24">
If he's defeated,
<br/>
he will lose all his females.
</p>
<p begin="00:10:25.96" id="p69" end="00:10:27.52">With one final effort,</p>
<p begin="00:10:27.52" id="p70" end="00:10:31.76">
the bull pushes the challenger
<br/>
back up the hill.
</p>
<p begin="00:10:43.56" id="p71" end="00:10:44.60">It's over.</p>
<p begin="00:10:48.60" id="p72" end="00:10:54.00">
The old bull successfully defended
<br/>
his rights as head of the family.
</p>
<p begin="00:11:00.84" id="p73" end="00:11:06.12">
And the challenger has to return
<br/>
to a lonely life for another year.
</p>
<p begin="00:11:13.16" id="p74" end="00:11:18.28">
One of Europe's last remaining areas
<br/>
of wilderness lies at its heart.
</p>
<p begin="00:11:19.56" id="p75" end="00:11:25.24">
A mountain range spanning
<br/>
750 miles across eight countries.

<p begin="00:11:38.52" id="p77" end="00:11:41.88">
Europe's mountain ranges
<br/>
may be inhospitable,
</p>
<p begin="00:11:41.88" id="p78" end="00:11:46.48">
but wildlife has shared this terrain
<br/>
with people for centuries.
</p>
<p begin="00:11:48.56" id="p79" end="00:11:52.64">BELL CHIMES</p>
<p begin="00:11:52.64" id="p80" end="00:11:57.80">
It's dusk in the mountain villages
<br/>
of Abruzzo, in central Italy.
</p>
<p begin="00:12:05.28" id="p81" end="00:12:07.60">And deep in the surrounding woods,</p>

thermal imaging cameras reveal the
<br/>
continent's most elusive predators.
</p>

<p begin="00:12:43.24" id="p86" end="00:12:47.48">
It's midwinter,

<p begin="00:12:48.96" id="p88" end="00:12:52.68">
This pack may not have fed for a
<br/>
week.
</p>
<p begin="00:12:59.76" id="p89" end="00:13:02.96">
They can travel many miles in a
<br/>
night,
</p>
<p begin="00:13:02.96" id="p90" end="00:13:04.48">searching for prey.</p>
<p begin="00:13:25.60" id="p91" end="00:13:27.72">Red deer.</p>
<p begin="00:13:30.88" id="p92" end="00:13:32.84">It's pitch-black.</p>
<p begin="00:13:35.80" id="p93" end="00:13:39.00">Perfect conditions for an ambush.</p>
<p begin="00:13:42.24" id="p94" end="00:13:43.60">But even so...</p>
<p begin="00:13:44.72" id="p95" end="00:13:48.04">
..the odds are stacked
<br/>
against the wolves.
</p>
<p begin="00:13:55.04" id="p96" end="00:13:56.56">TWIG SNAPS</p>
<p begin="00:13:57.60" id="p97" end="00:14:00.28">One wrong footstep,</p>
<p begin="00:14:00.28" id="p98" end="00:14:03.72">
and they have lost
<br/>
the advantage of surprise.
</p>
<p begin="00:14:19.40" id="p99" end="00:14:24.84">
The deer scatter
<br/>
right across the mountainside.
</p>
<p begin="00:14:36.72" id="p100" end="00:14:38.52">And to make matters worse,</p>
<p begin="00:14:38.52" id="p101" end="00:14:40.36">the hunt is interrupted.</p>
<p begin="00:14:42.00" id="p102" end="00:14:43.80">VEHICLE ZOOMS PAST</p>
<p begin="00:14:49.52" id="p103" end="00:14:53.04">
The deer are now high up the
<br/>
mountain.
</p>
<p begin="00:14:56.56" id="p104" end="00:15:02.92">
But the wolves use the road
<br/>
to travel faster and in silence.
</p>
<p begin="00:15:18.96" id="p105" end="00:15:21.64">They manage to get above the herd.</p>
<p begin="00:15:33.52" id="p106" end="00:15:36.36">Now they make their move.</p>
<p begin="00:15:37.80" id="p107" end="00:15:40.16">RUSTLING</p>
<p begin="00:15:52.60" id="p108" end="00:15:55.84">
The pack needs to single out one
<br/>
animal.
</p>
<p begin="00:16:10.12" id="p109" end="00:16:13.52">
A wolf is more nimble in thick
<br/>
woodland,
</p>
<p begin="00:16:13.52" id="p110" end="00:16:16.92">
but a deer can run faster on open
<br/>
ground.
</p>
<p begin="00:16:22.64" id="p111" end="00:16:26.12">
Once they're close,
<br/>
the pack drive the deer
</p>
<p begin="00:16:26.12" id="p112" end="00:16:28.36">straight down the mountain.</p>
<p begin="00:16:31.16" id="p113" end="00:16:33.72">And now it's more likely to stumble.</p>

In this case, the icy road proves

fatal.

<p begin="00:16:54.76" id="p117" end="00:16:58.96">
But the commotion has attracted
<br/>
sheepdogs from the nearby village.
</p>
<p begin="00:17:01.72" id="p118" end="00:17:06.72">
They have been bred to protect
<br/>
livestock by chasing away wolves.
</p>
<p begin="00:17:12.20" id="p119" end="00:17:15.24">BARKING CONTINUES</p>
<p begin="00:17:23.64" id="p120" end="00:17:26.20">With the kill lost to the sheepdogs,</p>
<p begin="00:17:26.20" id="p121" end="00:17:29.04">the wolves will go hungry</p>
<p begin="00:17:29.04" id="p122" end="00:17:30.84">for yet another night.</p>
<p begin="00:17:50.68" id="p123" end="00:17:56.00">
Today, much of Europe's wildlife

They have feathery gills which

<p begin="00:46:09.48" id="p322" end="00:46:16.24">

DAVID ATTENBOROUGH: Europe's
<br/>
predators are rare and elusive...
</p>
<p begin="00:48:16.56" id="p338" end="00:48:20.84">
..and none more so
<br/>
than the Iberian lynx...
</p>
<p begin="00:48:22.44" id="p339" end="00:48:24.12">..and the grey wolf.</p>

<p begin="00:48:25.84" id="p341" end="00:48:28.48">
Just finding them can be
<br/>
difficult...
</p>
<p begin="00:48:28.48" id="p342" end="00:48:31.52">It's completely pitch-black now.</p>
<p begin="00:48:34.36" id="p343" end="00:48:36.00">..let alone filming them.</p>
<p begin="00:48:36.00" id="p344" end="00:48:41.32">
We are packing up the kit...again,
<br/>
cos it's raining...again.
</p>
<p begin="00:48:42.76" id="p345" end="00:48:46.04">
Two crews set off
<br/>
to different countries...
</p>
<p begin="00:48:48.00" id="p346" end="00:48:51.16">..armed with different technology,</p>
<p begin="00:48:51.16" id="p347" end="00:48:55.00">but united by a single mission.</p>
<p begin="00:48:58.56" id="p348" end="00:49:03.92">
One team travelled to the heart
<br/>
of the Apennine Mountains in Italy,
</p>
<p begin="00:49:03.92" id="p349" end="00:49:07.00">
where wolf sightings had been
<br/>
reported.
</p>
<p begin="00:49:15.20" id="p350" end="00:49:18.24">Using the latest thermal camera,</p>
<p begin="00:49:18.24" id="p351" end="00:49:21.88">
the team will be able to film the
<br/>
wolves in the darkness,
</p>
<p begin="00:49:21.88" id="p352" end="00:49:23.68">when they're most active.</p>
<p style="s1" begin="00:49:26.56" id="p353" end="00:49:28.72">This is quite a beast of a camera,</p>
<p style="s1" begin="00:49:28.72" id="p354" end="00:49:31.72">
but it can see way into the
<br/>
distance.
</p>
<p style="s1" begin="00:49:31.72" id="p355" end="00:49:36.72">
So if anything warm-blooded appears
<br/>
on the landscape, I'll see it for
<br/>
sure.
</p>
<p style="s1" begin="00:49:37.92" id="p356" end="00:49:40.84">
We just need
<br/>
that little stroke of luck now.
</p>
<p begin="00:49:42.20" id="p357" end="00:49:44.92">But luck is not on their side.</p>
<p style="s1" begin="00:49:47.08" id="p358" end="00:49:48.84">Whoo!</p>
<p style="s1" begin="00:49:48.84" id="p359" end="00:49:51.72">Hold on to your horses,</p>
<p style="s1" begin="00:49:51.72" id="p360" end="00:49:54.96">
it's blowing an absolute hoolie out

</p>
<p style="s1" begin="00:49:54.96" id="p361" end="00:49:59.12">
I think this hide is just going to

literally blow off the mountain.
</p>
<p begin="00:50:01.28" id="p362" end="00:50:05.60">
In Spain, the lynx team
<br/>
are taking a different approach.
</p>
<p begin="00:50:07.92" id="p363" end="00:50:12.04">Camera traps, and lots of them.</p>
<p style="s2" begin="00:50:12.04" id="p364" end="00:50:14.64">So we've got one camera here,</p>
<p style="s2" begin="00:50:14.64" id="p365" end="00:50:17.56">
one camera hidden in the olive
<br/>
groves here
</p>
<p style="s2" begin="00:50:17.56" id="p366" end="00:50:19.96">
and one camera,
<br/>
which you might just be able to see,
</p>
<p style="s2" begin="00:50:19.96" id="p367" end="00:50:23.08">hidden in the olive groves there.</p>
<p begin="00:50:25.76" id="p368" end="00:50:30.04">
The crew rigs remote cameras
<br/>
wherever the lynx are known to
<br/>
roam...
</p>
<p begin="00:50:34.12" id="p369" end="00:50:38.20">
..including
<br/>
some surprisingly busy locations.
</p>
<p style="s2" begin="00:50:39.88" id="p370" end="00:50:42.16">
We've been told
<br/>
that they use these underpasses
</p>
<p style="s2" begin="00:50:42.16" id="p371" end="00:50:44.36">
to get underneath this massive
<br/>
motorway,
</p>
<p style="s2" begin="00:50:44.36" id="p372" end="00:50:47.48">
so we're going to work out
<br/>
where to put our cameras
</p>
<p style="s2" begin="00:50:47.48" id="p373" end="00:50:51.36">
and hopefully capture them moving
<br/>
around this urban environment.
</p>
<p begin="00:50:51.36" id="p374" end="00:50:53.56">To record enough footage,</p>
<p begin="00:50:53.56" id="p375" end="00:50:58.72">
the cameras will need to be left
<br/>
in the field for six months.
</p>
<p begin="00:50:58.72" id="p376" end="00:51:03.88">
With the last one set,
<br/>
the long wait begins.
</p>
<p begin="00:51:08.20" id="p377" end="00:51:11.48">In the mountains of Italy,</p>
<p begin="00:51:11.48" id="p378" end="00:51:13.88">the weather has improved,</p>
<p begin="00:51:13.88" id="p379" end="00:51:15.44">but that is all.</p>
<p style="s1" begin="00:51:16.68" id="p380" end="00:51:19.28">
So we're about halfway
<br/>
through the shoot now,
</p>
<p style="s1" begin="00:51:19.28" id="p381" end="00:51:21.12">
and we don't know where the wolves
<br/>
are.
</p>
<p style="s1" begin="00:51:21.12" id="p382" end="00:51:24.60">I'm pretty gutted.</p>
<p style="s1" begin="00:51:24.60" id="p383" end="00:51:26.92">
Going to have to just stay here
<br/>
through the night, scanning
</p>
<p style="s1" begin="00:51:26.92" id="p384" end="00:51:28.08">with the thermal camera</p>
<p style="s1" begin="00:51:28.08" id="p385" end="00:51:32.48">

<br/>
appear on the landscape.
</p>
<p style="s1" begin="00:51:32.48" id="p386" end="00:51:34.64">

<p style="s3" begin="00:51:46.32" id="p388" end="00:51:49.52">
We got a report last night that

<p style="s3" begin="00:51:49.52" id="p389" end="00:51:52.52">
so, you know,
<br/>
we've been going into the wilderness
</p>
<p style="s3" begin="00:51:52.52" id="p390" end="00:51:54.52">to try and find wolves,</p>
<p style="s3" begin="00:51:54.52" id="p391" end="00:51:57.88">
when actually they've just been
<br/>
on our doorstep in the village.
</p>
<p style="s2" begin="00:51:59.28" id="p392" end="00:52:03.16">
The wolf must have chased the deer
<br/>
from there, and it tried to jump.
</p>
<p style="s2" begin="00:52:03.16" id="p393" end="00:52:05.88">
But it...it got stuck here
<br/>
because of all the...all the fur.
</p>
<p style="s2" begin="00:52:05.88" id="p394" end="00:52:07.40">You see, also there is some...</p>
<p style="s2" begin="00:52:07.40" id="p395" end="00:52:10.20">..also some...some wolf fur here.</p>

we've seen since we've been here.

<p style="s3" begin="00:52:14.60" id="p398" end="00:52:17.92">
I just wouldn't have thought

<p style="s3" begin="00:52:22.48" id="p400" end="00:52:24.20">Yeah, we're changing strategy.</p>
<p style="s3" begin="00:52:24.20" id="p401" end="00:52:26.68">Um, I've moved the camera teams</p>
<p style="s3" begin="00:52:26.68" id="p402" end="00:52:29.76">
to a car park above the village

<p begin="00:52:37.88" id="p405" end="00:52:43.24">

<p style="s2" begin="00:53:54.84" id="p426" end="00:53:57.16">
there's so much rain coming down
<br/>
from the mountain.
</p>
<p begin="00:54:03.52" id="p427" end="00:54:09.12">
The only option is to bring
<br/>
all the cameras back to base.
</p>
<p style="s3" begin="00:54:09.12" id="p428" end="00:54:11.76">I'm hooking it up, drying it out,</p>
<p style="s3" begin="00:54:11.76" id="p429" end="00:54:14.48">
finding out where water's getting in
<br/>
and sealing it.
</p>
<p begin="00:54:14.48" id="p430" end="00:54:19.56">
With ten camera traps to fix,
<br/>
the crew work around the clock
</p>
<p begin="00:54:19.56" id="p431" end="00:54:23.08">until the last one is ready.</p>
<p style="s3" begin="00:54:23.08" id="p432" end="00:54:25.92">It looks like we're good to go.</p>
<p begin="00:54:27.32" id="p433" end="00:54:32.56">
But the team can't re-rig the
<br/>
cameras while it's still raining.
</p>
<p begin="00:54:34.48" id="p434" end="00:54:38.56">
And the weather shows no sign
<br/>
of improving.
</p>
<p style="s1" begin="00:54:39.64" id="p435" end="00:54:43.16">
We really want to find these lynx,
<br/>
but without...
</p>
<p style="s1" begin="00:54:43.16" id="p436" end="00:54:46.32">
..without a couple of dry days
<br/>
to set the kit up,
</p>
<p style="s1" begin="00:54:46.32" id="p437" end="00:54:48.80">we're...we're up against it now.</p>
<p style="s2" begin="00:54:51.84" id="p438" end="00:54:54.56">All we can do is wait, I guess.</p>
<p begin="00:55:01.24" id="p439" end="00:55:06.40">
Eventually, the rains pass
<br/>
and the crew set up the camera
<br/>
traps.
</p>
<p style="s2" begin="00:55:06.40" id="p440" end="00:55:07.84">This is the last one.</p>
<p style="s2" begin="00:55:07.84" id="p441" end="00:55:11.04">
I'm going to close it up, and then
<br/>
we're going to leave it for a month.
</p>
<p style="s2" begin="00:55:11.04" id="p442" end="00:55:14.88">
It feels really fitting to be ending
<br/>
on a really lovely sunny day
</p>
<p style="s2" begin="00:55:14.88" id="p443" end="00:55:17.00">with everything working perfectly.</p>
<p style="s2" begin="00:55:17.00" id="p444" end="00:55:20.60">
So I'm feeling quite confident
<br/>
and positive.
</p>
<p style="s2" begin="00:55:20.60" id="p445" end="00:55:23.80">
Hopefully,
<br/>
this will get us some lynx shots.
</p>
<p begin="00:55:28.52" id="p446" end="00:55:32.72">
In Italy, the thermal camera
<br/>
is allowing the team
</p>
<p begin="00:55:32.72" id="p447" end="00:55:38.08">
to reveal, for the first time,
<br/>
the secret lives of Europe's wolves.
</p>
<p begin="00:55:40.24" id="p448" end="00:55:45.84">
And it appears that they live much
<br/>
closer to home than anyone thought.
</p>
<p style="s1" begin="00:55:45.84" id="p449" end="00:55:48.96">They're just so close to the road.</p>
<p style="s1" begin="00:55:48.96" id="p450" end="00:55:51.40">
You've got the village
<br/>
up in the background,
</p>
<p style="s1" begin="00:55:51.40" id="p451" end="00:55:52.80">and I can see the houses.</p>
<p style="s1" begin="00:55:52.80" id="p452" end="00:55:57.60">
There's people sleeping all around,
<br/>
and yet they're so confident,
</p>
<p style="s1" begin="00:55:57.60" id="p453" end="00:56:02.20">
so confident, they're undisturbed
<br/>
by, uh, all the humanity that's
<br/>
around them.
</p>
<p style="s1" begin="00:56:06.56" id="p454" end="00:56:10.80">
It's just amazing to me that they
<br/>
know how to stay out of sight
</p>
<p style="s1" begin="00:56:10.80" id="p455" end="00:56:13.28">but be so close to humanity.</p>
<p style="s1" begin="00:56:14.36" id="p456" end="00:56:16.68">They just have this night shift.</p>
<p style="s1" begin="00:56:16.68" id="p457" end="00:56:18.44">
and then they just meld away
<br/>
into the shadows.
</p>
<p begin="00:56:20.88" id="p458" end="00:56:25.80">
And it's not just the wolf team
<br/>
making surprising discoveries.
</p>
<p begin="00:56:27.20" id="p459" end="00:56:32.64">
Camera trap footage reveals
<br/>
how confident the Iberian lynx is,
</p>
<p begin="00:56:32.64" id="p460" end="00:56:34.56">living alongside people.</p>
<p begin="00:56:37.48" id="p461" end="00:56:42.52">
And towards the end of the trip,
<br/>
the team have a memorable encounter.
</p>
<p style="s2" begin="00:56:42.52" id="p462" end="00:56:45.68">
We've just woken up
<br/>
from staying in the house,
</p>
<p style="s2" begin="00:56:45.68" id="p463" end="00:56:47.12">and we've had a visitor overnight.</p>
<p style="s2" begin="00:56:48.64" id="p464" end="00:56:55.20">
To see a wild lynx up this close
<br/>
is, yeah, completely amazing.
</p>
<p begin="00:56:55.20" id="p465" end="00:56:58.92">
It was a surprising revelation
<br/>
for both teams
</p>
<p begin="00:56:58.92" id="p466" end="00:57:02.20">
to find the continent's
<br/>
most elusive predators
